# Multithreaded Game Loop Simulator
A C++ project simulating a chase game using multithreading.
- Features: Player escapes while enemy chases with adjustable speed and real-time distance tracking.
- Tech: C++, std::thread, std::mutex.
- Purpose: Demonstrates concurrent task handling and synchronization for game-like scenarios.

Sample Output:
Starting chase game...
Player: (1, 2)
Enemy: (8, 8)
Distance: 13
Player: (2, 4)
Enemy: (6, 6)
